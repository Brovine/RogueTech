    "Details": "The Actuator Enhancement System (AES) is a combination of finely tuned myomer bundles and an enhanced DI computer interface that can improve the workings of a BattleMech's limbs. In many ways similar to the acuity enhancing servos and mechanisms tied into enhanced targeting computers, AES components serve to stabilize subtle variances in gross 'Mech movements, which can lead to greater weapon precision or improved balance adjustments. However, the systems are heavy and bulky.",
