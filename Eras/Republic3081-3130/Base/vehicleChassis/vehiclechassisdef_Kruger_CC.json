    "Details": "The modern Kruger Combat Car is a scout vehicle reintroduced in the Thirty-second century as an update of the much older original Kruger Combat Car introduced in 2620. The modern Kruger was developed by the Avalon Arms Company on New Avalon and marketed initially to the Armed Forces of the Federated Suns in 3091. Updated to use advanced equipment and technologies, the Kruger is a popular reconnaissance vehicle for scout detachments operating in the spinward Inner Sphere as well as neighboring Periphery nations. Lightly armed, it has a pair of turret mounted ER medium lasers and features a DAV 50 Fusion engine that powers the Kruger to speeds of up to 118 km/h.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 7/11 Hex: 210/330 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Heavy Ferro-Fibrous\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>        80      5\n<b>Left</b>          70      5\n<b>Right</b>        70      5\n<b>Rear</b>         70      5\n<b>Turret</b>       65      5\n\n<b>Total</b>      355     25</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Improved Communications</color>",
