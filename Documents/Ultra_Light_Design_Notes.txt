Notes for building a UltraLight Squad - Kagorus

    /core/RogueModuleTech/UltraLight/
     
    Engines:
        Generally you'll need to make a new engine if you make a new Ultralight, due to tonnage shared with the gyro and not all ultralights have a 1T Gryo, some are XL
        Some Have Endo (Easiest to add it to the engines of the ultralight) (only other place is quirk) and if the squad size changes you need a new engine too

        Engine Weight Calculation (Tonnage)
            (Core Weight + Gyro) * Squad Size
            Roadrunner : 4.5+3 * 2  :  (Engine+Gyro) *2 = 15
        Engine Rating
            Double The Core Value (as you have two Mechs)
        Armor & Structure Modifiers
            If you have any armor/structure  modifiers do it in the engine file. Endo/Ferro ect (only other place is quirk)
    
    Internals:
        Gear_Ultra_Light_Squad_General
            Never Needs to change.
        Gear_Ultra_Light_Squad_Mech_*
            Use the base file for normal 4 squad ultralights
                You only need to make a new one of these if you not using a squad of 4 or 2

                Tonnage: Cockpit(3T) * Squad Members.

    Squad Sizes:
        Currently theres a X2 and a X4 json
            MITE is X4
            Roadrunner is X2
            Order for squad members RT LT CT RA LA
            Remember to add/take away Proto arms (Gear_Protomech_Hands_Light)
